# Project-Embeding-Videos

Microverse's project like a Youtube's page. The point of the project is to practice basic HTML and CSS concepts. For this project we are going to clone YouTube player page. We used this web archive link: http://archive.today/Bss88 as a source page. The webpage should contain navbar, video and a sidebar with recommended videos.

Navbar should have an embedded image(logo). The logo should be on the left side of the navbar. There should be an input tag(search bar), search bar should be aligned to the middle. There should also be a button(search button). The buttong should be to the right side. There should also be three embedded images on the rightmost part of the navbar to repsent icons and an avatar.

Video should be displayed, show the video title, shows the number of views, have like and dislike icons, have a share button, show the avatar of the user who uploaded the video, have a subscribe button.

Sidebar should shos the recommended video’s thumbnail preview (as image not as an actual video), the title of the video and the number of views.
